# inflow

A Clojure library designed to do simple multi-hypothesis Bayesian
inference.  I've written it to help me with working through a text book
but it may have wider interest.

To get up to speed on this please read the [Marginalia](http://ejackson.github.com/inflow), and have
a look at the [blog post](http://www.boss-level.com) about it.
